<h1 id="ADAS-Features">🛡️ ADAS Features Explained</h1>

This project implements three critical safety systems through a unified computer vision architecture:

### 1. FCWS (Forward Collision Warning System)
The **FCWS** acts as a digital eye monitoring the space ahead. Using **YOLOv8**, the system detects vehicles (cars, trucks, buses) and classifies them in real-time. By analyzing the bounding box scale and position, it estimates the distance to the vehicle in front. If the distance decreases rapidly, the system alerts the driver via a "WARNING" or "PROMPT" overlay to prevent rear-end collisions.

### 2. LDWS (Lane Departure Warning System)
The **LDWS** is designed to prevent accidents caused by lane drifting. Using the **UFLDv2** model, the system identifies the ego-lane boundaries. It monitors the vehicle's position relative to these lines; if the vehicle’s tire approaches or touches the lane markings without a steering intent, the system triggers a "Departure Warning," visually indicating which side the vehicle is drifting toward.

### 3. LKAS (Lane Keeping Assist System)
**LKAS** provides higher-level guidance by calculating the vehicle's exact trajectory. It transforms the front camera view into a **Bird's Eye View (BEV)** to calculate:
* **Lateral Offset:** The distance (in cm) from the vehicle's center to the lane center.
* **Curvature Tracking:** Identifying if the road is curving (Straight, Easy Left/Right, or Hard Left/Right).
This data provides a "Normal" keep-straight guidance to ensure the driver stays centered.

<h1 id="Dataset">📊 Dataset</h1>

The models used in this project were tested and validated using a diverse driving dataset to ensure reliability in different environments.

* **Dataset Source:** [Kaggle - Driving Video for Lane Detection (Various Weather)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashikadnan/driving-video-for-lane-detection-various-weather)
* **Description:** This dataset includes high-quality driving footage captured during daylight, nighttime, and rainy conditions, which was essential for calibrating our LDWS and LKAS logic against glare and reflections.

<h1 id="Core-Methodology">🧠 Workflow Methodology</h1>

The software operates as a multi-stage computer vision pipeline designed for high-efficiency inference using **ONNX Runtime**.

### Phase 1: Data Ingestion & Preprocessing
Raw video frames are captured and normalized (pixel values scaled 0-1) to match the input tensor requirements of YOLOv8 and UFLDv2. This ensures consistent accuracy across different lighting conditions.

### Phase 2: Parallel AI Inference
Two distinct deep learning models run concurrently to analyze the scene:
* **Vehicle Perception (YOLOv8):** Scans the frame to identify and categorize cars, trucks, and obstacles.
* **Lane Segmentation (UFLDv2):** Treats lane detection as a row-based classification task to rapidly predict the precise location of lane markings (anchors).

### Phase 3: Temporal Tracking & Spatial Mapping
* **Multi-Object Tracking (ByteTrack):** Raw detections are fed into a **Kalman Filter** to predict future positions and maintain persistent IDs for vehicles, even during temporary occlusions.
* **Bird's-Eye View (BEV) Transformation:** An **Inverse Perspective Mapping (IPM)** matrix transforms the skewed camera view into a top-down 2D view. This allows the system to convert pixel distances into real-world metric units (cm) for accurate offset and curvature calculation.

### Phase 4: Safety Logic & Decision Gate
The system calculates the lateral distance from the vehicle center to the detected ego-lane center. If the offset exceeds safety thresholds, specific warnings (LDWS/FCWS) are triggered based on Time-to-Collision (TTC) and lateral drift speed.

### Phase 5: Visualization & Final Output
The system draws dynamic bounding boxes, polygonal lane overlays (colored Green for Safe or Red for Warning), and an ADAS dashboard directly onto the output video stream.

### 3.1 Download Weights
Download your desired pre-trained models from the links provided in the Model Zoo section. These weights are typically provided in PyTorch format (.pth or .pt).

### 3.2 Convert PyTorch to ONNX
We provide a dedicated script to handle the conversion for the lane detection system.
* Open the file TrafficLaneDetector\convertPytorchToONNX.py.

* Locate the model path variable and pasted the path to your downloaded PyTorch file there.

* Run the conversion script in your terminal:
 ```powershell
 python TrafficLaneDetector\convertPytorchToONNX.py
 ```
### 3.3 Configure main.py
Once the conversion is complete, paste the resulting ONNX model paths into the configuration section of main.py to ensure the program can locate the optimized engines.

### 4 Run Main
```powershell
python main.py
```
